  <h4>Photography</h4>
  <p>I take a lot of photos, but normally they don't go anywhere. I'm going to start trying to put some iPhone photos on Instagram and MILC photos here.</p>
  <p>I borrowed my mother's DSLR for years as a child, and went through a few point and shoots myself. Got my Fujifilm X-T1 in 2015. I do most of my processing in Adobe Lightroom and have played around with Affinity Photo. I'm interested in the beauty and intrigue of the shapes in the world around me. Great framing excites me; the aesthetic qualities of an image appeal to me as much as its subject.</p>
  <p>I also processed astronomical images for the Middlebury College observatory, available <a href="links/obsv_imgs.html">here</a>.</p>
