  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>Your brain is smarter than you. When you let go of concious choice, you find the best results. Iâ€™ve tried to apply this concept to everything around me, whether with lyrics in my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacobbrady/sets/sketches-in-air">music</a> or executing a behind-the-back shot of a soymilk container into the recycling bin.</p>
  <p>I'm drawn to cleanliness, simiplicity, and minimalism.</p>
  <p>I love athletics, and most forms of self-propelled cruising in the outdoors. Check me out on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10671693">strava</a>.</p>
  <p>Art is great; I've done a few <a href="files/my_wh_replicas.jpg">oil paintings</a>, taken thousands of <a href="links/photo.html" target="_self">photos</a>, and produced some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacobbrady/">songs</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/170727021">films</a>.</p>
  <p>Writing clean and aesthetic code is my favorite part of <span class="font-weight-regular">programming</span>, especially if the code creates something beautiful as well.</p>
  <p>Holding a mindset of eternal curiosity, I believe <span class="bold">everything is interesting</span>. I try to spend most of my time pushing aside the worldview lens set in front of me by society and the culture I live in, and seeing the infinite possibilities of life.</p>
  <p>I love pondering over the scale of the universe and observing the wonderous sky above.</p>
